    <h1> Welcome to Pig Dice: The Game </h1>

       <h2> Here is how the Game Works:</h2>

       <p  id="rules"> 
            There are 2 players, Player 1 and Player 2, The goal is to reach 100 (or more) points using ONE six sided dice and the 
            built in Score Keeper. 
       </p>

       <p id="rules"> 
            On a turn, a player rolls the die repeatedly to accumulate as many points as possible, However should the player
            roll a 1, their accumulated points for that round are lost, and thus it goes to the next player.
       </p>

       <p id="rules"> 
            A Player can also choose to hold (Stop rolling the die) if they don't want to take the change of rolling a 1
            thus ending their turn and getting their accumulated points for that turn added to their total score.   
       </p>

       <p id="rules">
            Once a Player reaches 100 or more, that Player wins.
       </p>
